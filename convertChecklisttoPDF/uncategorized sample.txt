	==Initial Discovery and 3rd Party Data Assessment Checklist
	In cases involving large volumes of data in a variety of media and/or file formats produced as part of the discovery and/or third party data obtained through independent investigation, the trial team should contact the National Litigation Support team and together try to answer the questions below. The answers will direct the work flow and assist the trial team in further planning their strategy and budget.==
	Is there any way to estimate the total volume of the discovery production even though some of it may come later?
	Will we be able to access all the data?
	Is any of the data encrypted?
	Are there specific types of documents that will be irrelevant to our case? (i.e. pictures, executable files, junk emails, etc.)
	Are there specific types of documents that will be very important to our case? (i.e. emails authored by a particular person, documents created during a specific time period, specific document types such as bank records, etc.)
	Are there both paper documents that have been scanned and native electronic files?
	Should we objectively code the scanned documents so that they can be integrated into the native file data set for purposes of searching and organization?
	Will there continue to be rolling discovery productions?
	Do we need to look at the entire production?
	Is there information that the government has not provided that needs to explicitly requested?
	In what format or formats do you want to request this information?
	Is there information that is not under the government’s control that needs to be obtained from 3rd party sources?
	In what format or formats is that information currently maintained?
	Can you obtain the third party information in a forensically sound manner so as to ensure proper chain of custody?
	Will the documents need to be shared among the Federal Defender Office, CJA Panel Attorneys and Retained Counsel?
	Does the trial team already have an Evidence Review Platform in their office that could handle the amount and variety of discovery involved?
	What is the timeline for completing the review?

	==An individual charged with driving while intoxicated has three main concerns: ==
	Driving Privileges
	The first concern is the State is trying to suspend his/her driving privileges because of the pending charges. Start by asking if the arresting officers took their driver’s license. If they still have their driver’s license, make a copy for your file, you may need the information later in your representation if you are hired. 
	Explain to them how important it is to have an administrative license revocation (ALR) hearing. Make them aware the hearing occurs in a different court and a different location from his/her criminal case. Advise them you will make this hearing on their behalf and they will not need to attend. It is actually in their best interest not to attend the hearing because the State could call them as a witness against himself/herself. 
	Timely filing an application for this hearing will keep the driving privileges from being suspended until the hearing can be held. The hearing before the administrative law judge must be requested no later than 15 days from the date of the State’s notice of the State’s intent to revoke the driving privileges. Date of notice is usually the day of arrest. If the 15 days have lapsed explain how their driving privileges will be automatically suspended 40 days after the notice. Make this hearing a part of your representation if it is not too late to file a request for the hearing. 
	Regarding their driving privilege: 
	What type of license do they have?
	Does their job require them to drive?
	What happens if they are not allowed to drive?
	What are the necessary driving times needed for work and/or personal errands?
	Have their driving privileges ever been suspended?
	Explain the effects on their driving privileges of an arrest and/or conviction for driving while intoxicated. For the suspension periods related to the client, refer to the DWI Suspension Period (cheat sheet) produced by the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association, sheet no. 7. Make sure they understand what they are facing regarding possible suspension of their driving privileges and assure them you will work diligently on their behalf to try and prevent the revocation of his/her driving privileges. 
	The second concern is the criminal charge and the possible consequences of a conviction. Make sure they completely know and understand the range of punishment he/she faces. 
	About the Criminal Charge
	Questions regarding the criminal charge of driving while intoxicated: (know the affect of his/her answers and make sure they understand how he/she will be affected) 
	What is their anticipation of what can be accomplish through your representation? 
	Have they, or anyone, made any prior court appearances on this charge? 
	When is the next scheduled appearance? 
	Have they ever been convicted of driving while intoxicated? 
	Do they have any prior convictions? 
	Will the pending charge or a conviction for driving while intoxication effect their job? 
	Will the pending charge or a conviction affect their ability to travel out of the country? 
	Do they feel they were intoxicated? 
	Where there any admissions to being intoxicated to any authority? 
	Have they posted anything about the arrest on the internet (social media)? 
	About The Individual
	Information you will need to know about your client after you are hired: 
	What are the drinking habits of the client? 
	Was the client taking medication? 
	Has the client had any prior injuries? 
	Do they have any physical or mental disabilities? 
	Are they under a doctor’s care? 
	What is their prior driving history? 
	Do they use unlawful drugs? 
	How much sleep had they had before arrest? 
	Do they have any speech impediments? 
	Have they ever been arrested for public intoxication? 
	About the Arrest
	Things you need to ask about the arrest: 
	What caused them to be arrested? 
	Date and time of the arrest? 
	Were they driving when they were arrested by the police officer? 
	Where were they going when the arrest occurred? 
	Where were they coming from? 
	Who saw them driving? 
	Where did the arrest occur? 
	Were they involved in any accident? 
	Were there any open containers of alcohol in the vehicle? 
	Any closed containers of alcohol in the vehicle? 
	Was anyone else with them when he/she was arrested? 
	Did they make statements to the arresting officer? 
	Did they perform any field sobriety tests? 
	Did they provide a sample of /her blood, breath or urine to the arresting officers? 
	How many police vehicles were on the scene of the arrest? 
	Did the police take them to a video room? 
	Was their vehicle towed to a storage yard or turned over to someone? 
	Where were they drinking before arrest? 
	What was the time of their last drink prior to the arrest? 
	What time did they eat prior to his/her arrest? 
	What time did they wake up/get up from sleeping on the day of his/her arrest? 
	What time did they have his/her first drink on the day of his/her arrest? 
	Had they had anything to drink on the previous day? 
	When would they say was the last time he/she was intoxicated? 
	How much alcohol did they consume on the day of arrest? 
	Who were they drinking with? 
	How did they pay for the alcohol? 
	Do they have any receipts for the alcohol? 
	Do they believe he/she has a problem with alcohol? 
	What is the age, weight and height of the client? 
	Consequences of Arrest and or Conviction
	Make sure they understand all the consequences of a conviction and what might occur while the charges are pending. During this phase you might want to discuss possible plea offers you anticipate the State will make. Make sure your client understands the consequences of pleading guilty to driving while intoxicated, even the downside of DIVERT. Make sure your client understands no plea offer should be entertained until the case is fully investigated, making sure the State will be able to make their case. 
	Petition for Occupational License
	The third concern is what will happen if my driving privileges are suspended. You need to discuss the petition for an occupational license and explain the process. Let your client know you can handle the petition and hearing for him/her. Explain the hearing may be in a civil court, which is completely separate from where his criminal charges are pending. 
	Conclusion
	Spending time with a potential client and providing answers for their concerns will pay dividends for the lawyer. A large percentage of individuals charged with driving while intoxicated have never been involved in the criminal justice system. They are concerned, scared and are looking for someone who can tell them what they are facing. Be that “someone”.

	==Mitigation – Telling the Client’s Story one Client copy - PPT
	Imagine you are defending this guy…arrested for PCS when police are serving a Blue Warrant at Client’s house and while searching the Client incident to arrest find a baggy of meth and a baggy of cocaine in Client’s shirt pocket. Client had Blue Warrant issued because he allegedly threatened to come back to the district parole office with a gun and shoot the entire place up. Client was a true habitual with Felony convictions going all the way back to 1977. Was a FOUNDING member of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas and still claimed membership. 
	There was another side to the story. 
	Protecting those of the Lord’s children who have fallen short of perfection from the wrath of those who have attained it. Stuart Kinnard
	Why Mitigation in Noncapital Cases: State Bar Performance Guidelines for Non Capital Defense Representation demand mitigation investigation and presentation. (Guidelines 1.2(c); 2.2(C)(5)(h); 4.1(B)(9)(e); 4.2(B)(3); 4.3; 8.1(c); 8.6(D). The Courts have ruled Defense Counsel has a duty to investigate and present mitigation evidence in noncaptical cases.
	US SUPREME COURT: In any criminal case, counsel must first evaluate what “conceivable line(s) of mitigating evidence” exist and then decide whether following any of those lines would likely lead to evidence that “would . . . assist the defendant at sentencing.” Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 3510, 521-22, 123 S. Ct. 2527, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2003).
	TEXAS COURTS: Failure to uncover and present mitigating evidence “cannot be justified as a tactical decision when defense counsel has not conducted a thorough investigation of the defendant’s background.” Shanklin v. State, 190 S.W.3d 154, 164 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, pet. dism’d); see also Bazan v. State, 403 S.W.3d 8, 13 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2012, pet. ref’d).==
	Mitigation in Non-Capital Cases
	What is Mitigation
	The mitigation investigation
	Presenting the mitigation evidence
	==What is Mitigation
	Alleviation; abatement or diminution of a penalty or punishment imposed by law.
	“Mitigating circumstances” are such as do not constitute a justification or excuse of the offense in question, but which, in fairness and mercy, may be considered as extenuating or reducing the degree of moral culpability.
	Another way to look at Mitigation…
	Being an effective story teller for your client in order to lessen the severity of the punishment your client is facing or receives
	Who is better to have tell your client’s story regarding your client’s punishment? You of the Prosecutor? YOU
	Sympathy v. Empathy
	Sympathy is defined as feelings of pity and sorry for someone else’s misfortune. Sympathy alone or mere Pity is never an effective Mitigation strategy
	Empathy is defined as getting another to understand and share the feelings of another. You always have a much better chance of achieving a positive result for your client if you can gain the Judge’s, Prosecutor’s or both’s empathy
	Mitigation is not trying to gain sympathy. Mitigation is about trying to gain an understanding of your client and their circumstances.==
	In order to effectively tell your client’s story, you must…
	Know your clients story (investigation)
	Develop a useful theme
