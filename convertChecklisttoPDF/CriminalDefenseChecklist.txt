	==Initial Discovery and 3rd Party Data Assessment Checklist
	In cases involving large volumes of data in a variety of media and/or file formats produced as part of the discovery and/or third party data obtained through independent investigation, the trial team should contact the National Litigation Support team and together try to answer the questions below. The answers will direct the work flow and assist the trial team in further planning their strategy and budget.==
	Is there any way to estimate the total volume of the discovery production even though some of it may come later?
	Will we be able to access all the data?
	Is any of the data encrypted?
	Are there specific types of documents that will be irrelevant to our case? (i.e. pictures, executable files, junk emails, etc.)
	Are there specific types of documents that will be very important to our case? (i.e. emails authored by a particular person, documents created during a specific time period, specific document types such as bank records, etc.)
	Are there both paper documents that have been scanned and native electronic files?
	Should we objectively code the scanned documents so that they can be integrated into the native file data set for purposes of searching and organization?
	Will there continue to be rolling discovery productions?
	Do we need to look at the entire production?
	Is there information that the government has not provided that needs to explicitly requested?
	In what format or formats do you want to request this information?
	Is there information that is not under the government’s control that needs to be obtained from 3rd party sources?
	In what format or formats is that information currently maintained?
	Can you obtain the third party information in a forensically sound manner so as to ensure proper chain of custody?
	Will the documents need to be shared among the Federal Defender Office, CJA Panel Attorneys and Retained Counsel?
	Does the trial team already have an Evidence Review Platform in their office that could handle the amount and variety of discovery involved?
	What is the timeline for completing the review?

If they still have their driver’s license, make a copy for your file, you may need the information later in your representation if you are hired. 
	Explain to them how important it is to have an administrative license revocation (ALR) hearing. Make them aware the hearing occurs in a different court and a different location from his/her criminal case. Advise them you will make this hearing on their behalf and they will not need to attend. It is actually in their best interest not to attend the hearing because the State could call them as a witness against himself/herself. 
	Timely filing an application for this hearing will keep the driving privileges from being suspended until the hearing can be held. The hearing before the administrative law judge must be requested no later than 15 days from the date of the State’s notice of the State’s intent to revoke the driving privileges. Date of notice is usually the day of arrest. If the 15 days have lapsed explain how their driving privileges will be automatically suspended 40 days after the notice. Make this hearing a part of your representation if it is not too late to file a request for the hearing. 
	Regarding their driving privilege: 
	What type of license do they have?
	Does their job require them to drive?
	What happens if they are not allowed to drive?
	What are the necessary driving times needed for work and/or personal errands?
	Have their driving privileges ever been suspended?
	Explain the effects on their driving privileges of an arrest and/or conviction for driving while intoxicated. For the suspension periods related to the client, refer to the DWI Suspension Period (cheat sheet) produced by the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association, sheet no. 7. Make sure they understand what they are facing regarding possible suspension of their driving privileges and assure them you will work diligently on their behalf to try and prevent the revocation of his/her driving privileges. 
	The second concern is the criminal charge and the possible consequences of a conviction. Make sure they completely know and understand the range of punishment he/she faces. 
	About the Criminal Charge
	Questions regarding the criminal charge of driving while intoxicated: (know the affect of his/her answers and make sure they understand how he/she will be affected) 
	What is their anticipation of what can be accomplish through your representation? 
	Have they, or anyone, made any prior court appearances on this charge? 
	When is the next scheduled appearance? 
	Have they ever been convicted of driving while intoxicated? 
	Do they have any prior convictions? 
	Will the pending charge or a conviction for driving while intoxication effect their job? 
	Will the pending charge or a conviction affect their ability to travel out of the country? 
	Do they feel they were intoxicated? 
	Where there any admissions to being intoxicated to any authority? 
	Have they posted anything about the arrest on the internet (social media)? 
	About The Individual
	Information you will need to know about your client after you are hired: 
	What are the drinking habits of the client? 
	Was the client taking medication? 
	Has the client had any prior injuries? 
	Do they have any physical or mental disabilities? 
	Are they under a doctor’s care? 
	What is their prior driving history? 
	Do they use unlawful drugs? 
	How much sleep had they had before arrest? 
	Do they have any speech impediments? 
	Have they ever been arrested for public intoxication? 
	About the Arrest
	Things you need to ask about the arrest: 
	What caused them to be arrested? 
	Date and time of the arrest? 
	Were they driving when they were arrested by the police officer? 
	Where were they going when the arrest occurred? 
	Where were they coming from? 
	Who saw them driving? 
	Where did the arrest occur? 
	Were they involved in any accident? 
	Were there any open containers of alcohol in the vehicle? 
	Any closed containers of alcohol in the vehicle? 
	Was anyone else with them when he/she was arrested? 
	Did they make statements to the arresting officer? 
	Did they perform any field sobriety tests? 
	Did they provide a sample of /her blood, breath or urine to the arresting officers? 
	How many police vehicles were on the scene of the arrest? 
	Did the police take them to a video room? 
	Was their vehicle towed to a storage yard or turned over to someone? 
	Where were they drinking before arrest? 
	What was the time of their last drink prior to the arrest? 
	What time did they eat prior to his/her arrest? 
	What time did they wake up/get up from sleeping on the day of his/her arrest? 
	What time did they have his/her first drink on the day of his/her arrest? 
	Had they had anything to drink on the previous day? 
	When would they say was the last time he/she was intoxicated? 
	How much alcohol did they consume on the day of arrest? 
	Who were they drinking with? 
	How did they pay for the alcohol? 
	Do they have any receipts for the alcohol? 
	Do they believe he/she has a problem with alcohol? 
	What is the age, weight and height of the client? 
	Consequences of Arrest and or Conviction
	Make sure they understand all the consequences of a conviction and what might occur while the charges are pending. During this phase you might want to discuss possible plea offers you anticipate the State will make. Make sure your client understands the consequences of pleading guilty to driving while intoxicated, even the downside of DIVERT. Make sure your client understands no plea offer should be entertained until the case is fully investigated, making sure the State will be able to make their case. 
	Petition for Occupational License
	The third concern is what will happen if my driving privileges are suspended. You need to discuss the petition for an occupational license and explain the process. Let your client know you can handle the petition and hearing for him/her. Explain the hearing may be in a civil court, which is completely separate from where his criminal charges are pending. 
	Conclusion
	Spending time with a potential client and providing answers for their concerns will pay dividends for the lawyer. A large percentage of individuals charged with driving while intoxicated have never been involved in the criminal justice system. They are concerned, scared and are looking for someone who can tell them what they are facing. Be that “someone”.

	==Mitigation – Telling the Client’s Story one Client copy - PPT
	Imagine you are defending this guy…arrested for PCS when police are serving a Blue Warrant at Client’s house and while searching the Client incident to arrest find a baggy of meth and a baggy of cocaine in Client’s shirt pocket. Client had Blue Warrant issued because he allegedly threatened to come back to the district parole office with a gun and shoot the entire place up. Client was a true habitual with Felony convictions going all the way back to 1977. Was a FOUNDING member of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas and still claimed membership. 
	There was another side to the story. 
	Protecting those of the Lord’s children who have fallen short of perfection from the wrath of those who have attained it. Stuart Kinnard
	Why Mitigation in Noncapital Cases: State Bar Performance Guidelines for Non Capital Defense Representation demand mitigation investigation and presentation. (Guidelines 1.2(c); 2.2(C)(5)(h); 4.1(B)(9)(e); 4.2(B)(3); 4.3; 8.1(c); 8.6(D). The Courts have ruled Defense Counsel has a duty to investigate and present mitigation evidence in noncaptical cases.
	US SUPREME COURT: In any criminal case, counsel must first evaluate what “conceivable line(s) of mitigating evidence” exist and then decide whether following any of those lines would likely lead to evidence that “would . . . assist the defendant at sentencing.” Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 3510, 521-22, 123 S. Ct. 2527, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2003).
	TEXAS COURTS: Failure to uncover and present mitigating evidence “cannot be justified as a tactical decision when defense counsel has not conducted a thorough investigation of the defendant’s background.” Shanklin v. State, 190 S.W.3d 154, 164 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, pet. dism’d); see also Bazan v. State, 403 S.W.3d 8, 13 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2012, pet. ref’d).==
	Mitigation in Non-Capital Cases
	What is Mitigation
	The mitigation investigation
	Presenting the mitigation evidence
	==What is Mitigation
	Alleviation; abatement or diminution of a penalty or punishment imposed by law.
	“Mitigating circumstances” are such as do not constitute a justification or excuse of the offense in question, but which, in fairness and mercy, may be considered as extenuating or reducing the degree of moral culpability.
	Another way to look at Mitigation…
	Being an effective story teller for your client in order to lessen the severity of the punishment your client is facing or receives
	Who is better to have tell your client’s story regarding your client’s punishment? You of the Prosecutor? YOU
	Sympathy v. Empathy
	Sympathy is defined as feelings of pity and sorry for someone else’s misfortune. Sympathy alone or mere Pity is never an effective Mitigation strategy
	Empathy is defined as getting another to understand and share the feelings of another. You always have a much better chance of achieving a positive result for your client if you can gain the Judge’s, Prosecutor’s or both’s empathy
	Mitigation is not trying to gain sympathy. Mitigation is about trying to gain an understanding of your client and their circumstances.==
	In order to effectively tell your client’s story, you must…
	Know your clients story (investigation)
	Develop a useful theme
	==How do you know your client’s story? Through a thorough and intensive mitigation investigation. 
	What are effective Mitigation Circumstances (Themes)==
	Remorse: The defendant accepts responsibility and shows remorse. For example, a defendant who confesses upon arrest and is contrite in court has this factor in his favor. 
	Lack of criminal record: The defendant doesn’t have a criminal record, or only has a relatively minor record. 
	No harm: The defendant didn’t hurt anyone and committed the crime in a manner unlikely to cause harm. An example would be if a Defendant carjacked a driver by sternly ordering her out of her car without pointing a weapon at the driver and carefully and gently helped driver out of car. 
	Minor role: The defendant played a relatively minor role in the crime. For example, suppose Defendant, a foot soldier, knowingly drove a Shotcaller in Defendant’s gang to a location where the Shotcaller made a drug deal. At sentencing for his conviction for Delivery of a controlled substance, Defendant has an argument that his small role in the criminal activity should be mitigating.
	Victim culpability: The victim willingly participated in the crime or initiated the events leading to it. For instance, if the complaining witness started a fight by attacking Defendant and Defendant responded with more force than was necessary to defend himself, this factor would be a mitigating factor at Defendant’s sentencing. 
	Unusual circumstance: The defendant committed the crime because of a temporary emotional difficulty or significant provocation and this caused the Defendant to act incongruous to the Defendant’s normal behavior and character. Ie – The perfect storm happened on the day the Defendant committed the crime. This circumstance usually applies when a defendant acts out while under extreme stress. 
	Relative necessity: The defendant acted out of a desire to provide life necessities. This theme would be potentially used for a recently laid off Defendant with no money who stole a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store so that he could feed his starving family.
	Addiction: Drug or alcohol addiction contributed to – but wasn’t just an incentive or excuse to commit – the crime. For instance if a someone continually committing petty thefts to fund drug usage. 
	Difficult personal history: The Defendant suffered continuous physical or sexual abuse either as a child or an adult. For example, battered woman syndrome.
	PTSD: The Defendant served in the military and as a result suffers from PTSD. Another example, a victim of a violent crime overacts during a confrontation and injures the complaining witness. 
	Mental Illness: Defendant suffers from some form of mental illness, or has a history of mental illness. This is particularly true is not properly treated.
	Institutional Failure: An example of institutional failure is the drug addict that has been through the criminal justice system many times but never received treatment to break the cycle of addiction.
	Lack of Family Structure/Absent Parent: Depends on the effect the lack of family or parent has on the individual.
	ANYTHING YOU THINK CAN GET THE TARGET AUDIENCE TO EMPATHIZE WITH YOUR CLIENT.
	==Don’t only focus on the negative aspects in Mitigation. Positives can be good mitigation themes also:==
	Someone is a good mother/father
	Someone is a good son/daughter
	Someone is a good sibling
	Someone I a good spouse
	Someone has made a positive impact in another persons life
	Someone has served the community (ie – volunteer or a public servant)
	Someone is extremely old or particularly young
	Someone is a good student
	Someone has a bright future ahead of them
	==You can combine together more than one mitigation circumstance or theme==
	For instance, someone who forced as a child to prostitute themselves by their mother, was given drugs to help her perform her required sexual acts, was never treated for her addictions despite numerous petty criminal convictions as a young adult is now charged with a crime as a young adult. You could combine as themes or mitigating circumstances – addiction, institutional failure, and difficult personal circumstance. 
	==Non-Capital Counsel can take a cue from Capital Counsel in effective Mitigation Themes==
	Capital Cases, the mitigation is required to focus on sentencing that takes into account the unique characteristics of the Defendant. – Tennard v. Dretke, 542 U.S. 274 (2004)
	==The same mitigation themes and circumstance that impact capital defendant’s and have been effective for capital defendant’s exist in our client’s Non-Capital cases==
	Examples: Poverty, Mental Retardation, Untreated or self treated mental illness, Addiction, Trauma, particularly head trauma, Lack of family structure/missing parent, Childhood history of abuse 
	How do you perform a mitigation investigation
	If at all possible, use a mitigation specialist (should be able to get one appointed under Ake and Greggs or make sure you build the cost into your fee)
	Incorporate a mitigation interview questions into counsels initial client interview
	Get a detailed family tree with contacts
	Mitigation/Punishment Witness interviews
	Identify and gather useful documents
	Potential People to Interview in Mitigation Investigation
	Client
	Client’s family
	Current Neighbors of Client
	Friends
	Preachers/Ministers
	Coaches
	Teachers
	Former Probation officers
	Former parole officers
	CPS workers is SPC was involved in Client’s life
	Employers/Co-Workers
	==Why a Mitigation Specialist==
	They are going to have expertise in gathering the documents and information necessary to tell the client’s story effectively
	They will have a network of experts needed to help develop the Clients story
	Mitigation specialists can help “connect the dots” and organize all the mitigation facts into a cohesive persuasive story
	Mitigation Specialists are trained to determine a Client’s deficits and create a plan to remedy or cure those deficits
	==Client Resistance to Mitigation Interview Questions==
	Clients don’t want to talk about mitigation or punishment because “I’m innocent” or “I didn’t do it” or some other variation
	In order to tell the client’s story, you have to get to know the client. Thus ask questions at first that help build a family tree and history, a social history, a medical history, employment history
	Let the client know you are just trying to get to know them as a person, as trust develops so will the other mitigation questions
	==Team Building Approach to Mitigation==
	Always try to make your client “part” of the team – get them invested in their own mitigation. Give them information to gather if on bond. If incarcerated, get them to give you the names of people to go to get the information you need.
	Use your Mitigation Specialist/Investigator to help gather documents and interview witnesses
	Look for younger attorneys who need experience and draft them to assist
	Develop your own network of experts and consult with them as needed
	==3 main areas of mitigation to look at==
	All the good the client has done in the past. This includes the client’s view of what good he has done, even if his view is not consistent with what society would think is good
	All the bad, sad and painful things that have happened to the client in their lifetime. Ie – What is the worst memory you have a childhood?
	Diagnostic questions designed to identify things such as head injuries, illness, substance abuse. Ie – do you remember as a kid ever having to go to the hospital? What for?
	==Questions you can ask to help develop possible mitigation evidence or themes==
	Are you on medications? If so what kinds and for how long?
	Ever gone to the hospital? If so what for? Which hospital? When? Where?
	Ever been diagnosed with a mental illness? If so what? When? By which doctor?
	Ever been hospitalized for mental health reasons? What for? When? Which hospital? By which doctor?
	Were you the victim of abuse (physical and/or sexual)? When? By whom? Did you report it to anyone and if so, who?
	What is your happiest memory?
	What is your favorite memory growing up?
	What is your earliest memory?
	What is something about you that you think would surprise me?
	==Develop a family tree==
	The best people to tell you about your client are the ones who have known him all his life. 
	Family members can tell you about things so traumatic to the client the client is repressing memories
	When a client is trying to minimize events or his actions in the past, family can help disprove the minimizations or help reveal the truth
	Family members can lead you to other potential sources of information such as friends of the client growing up, coaches or other close associates.
	==The Family interview==
	You have to build a relationship with the family to gain their trust
	You will have to overcome the family’s initial desire to only emphasize the good of their loved one or minimize the bad
	Realize that you will be potentially asking the family to reveal trauma, and this can be re-traumatizing. This can not be rushed. Requires building trust. 
	Do not judge
	Ask open ended questions
	Most importantly…LISTEN
	==Mitigation Witness Interviews==
	You have to build a relationship just like with the family to gain their trust
	Don’t be afraid to ask difficult questions. This is information you need
	Just like with the family, do not judge
	Ask open ended questions
	Most importantly….LISTEN
	==Goal of family/Witness interviews==
	Getting to learn the client’s story so you can effectively tell the client’s story
	Allow the defense/mitigation team to be able to see the Client through the eyes of people who see the Client not as a criminal but as a human being. Have to be able to humanize the client in order to effectively tell a story to gain empathy for the client.
	==Releases you will need your client to sign==
	A general HIPPA release
	A FURPA release for educational background
	HIPPA release specific to MHMR
	If a military veteran – a Veterans Administration release, a release to get the client’s military records
	These are documents you will need to start performing a paper mitigation investigation
	==Information helpful/needed to build a proper mitigation case==
	Medical history
	Family tree
	Mental health history
	Education history
	Employment history
	Military History
	Criminal History
	Full investigation into the crime itself
	==Presenting the Mitigation==
	Sometimes you will be presenting it to the Prosecutor pre-trial
	Sometimes you will be presenting it to a judge after a trial or punishment hearing
	Sometimes will have to present it to a jury after a trial
	This is where you connect the dots
	This is where you turn all the facts and data you have into a cohesive, persuasive story
	This is where you have to apply what you know into appropriate mitigation themes/mitigation circumstances
	The Ultimate goal is to tell your Client’s story in such a way that gets the intended target of your story gains empathy for your client
	==Presenting to the prosecutor==
	Have to overcome prosecutors automatic prejudice against client – have to gain empathy for your client
	Have to overcome prosecutor’s world view. Their view of justice is true justice. They are always in their minds fair – even when they are not being fair. Most any mitigation circumstance, alone, is an excuse and only an excuse. The Defendant is a liar and will lie to everyone. The defendant’s family are enablers.
	If you succeed in getting the prosecutor to see your client as a human being and not just another “Defendant” you can get the prosecutor to start empathizing with your client
	==Presenting to a Judge==
	Once again, your story has to gain empathy from the judge
	Judges have to get re-elected, so your story should help convince a judge to take a chance on your client and that act of “kindness” won’t be rewarded by the client coming back to haunt the judge
	Sometimes have to overcome the same world views you have to overcome when presenting to a prosecutor
	==Presenting to a jury==
	Has to start at voir dire. Not only educate the jurors on the punishment range, but also on the mitigation themes. Have to identify jurors predisposed not to listen to your mitigation theme.
	Through your client’s story, you have to educate the juror’s to see your Client’s world and the realities they live in. Usually a juror’s view of the world miles away from the reality of your client
	Not trying to make excuses for your Client’s conduct, trying to gain empathy from the jury
	Try to get the target audience to understand, who must not be defined by the worst thing they ever did
	People may forget what you tell them or what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. 
	Tell a cohesive, persuasive story for your client and you will be able to gain the necessary empathy for your client to gain a result that very well may save a significant portion of their life!!!!
	==THE CLIENT INTERVIEW: A TOPICAL CHECKLIST
	In developing mitigation for post-Booker sentencings, our clients are often our best and most accessible source of information. In the abstract, the mitigation possibilities seem endless, and it may be difficult to decide what to ask our clients and how to ask it. This checklist is designed to give you some guidance. Although it is not intended as a script for client interviews, it may be useful for attorneys to review the checklist in connection with each case as a brainstorming tool.
	In collecting information from clients, remember two important principles: First, try not to be too result-oriented. Sometimes, you just have to listen and let the client take the interview where he/she wants to go. You will not elicit too much useful information if you exert too much control in the conversation. Second, be alert to verbal and non-verbal cues suggesting abuse, mental illness, or cognitive impairment. See Deana Logan, Learning to Observe Signs of Mental Impairment (distributed in connection with May 2005 CJA Panel Training). Sometimes, your client won’t be able to tell you what’s mitigating, but you’ll discern it through careful observation. 
	If you have any questions about a client’s response to questions or a behaviour you observe, you may want to consult the library of materials on mental health issues in criminal cases and conducting mitigation investigation, assembled by Assistant Federal Public Defenders Denise Barrett and Frank Draper, and available at the FPD’s Baltimore office. Also consider consulting a social worker, a mitigation specialist, or a mental health professional. 
	Initial Interview
	This basic information should be collected early on (at the initial appearance, if possible). These are the questions asked at intake by Assistant Federal Public Defenders. The answers provide the basis for establishing a “family liaison” (a close friend or family member of the client who can become an ally for the attorney during the investigation & litigation), and beginning the investigation (ordering basic documents such as education, criminal, and medical records).==

	Circumstances or searches/seizures (consent, warrant, auto, etc)
	Witnesses to arrest
	Others arrested
	Circumstances of any statements (oral, written, read rights, invoke rights, length, place, method of interrogation)
	When taken to magistrate
	At the initial meeting, also have the client complete release of information forms (copies distributed in connected with Mary 2005 CJA Training), so you can easily retrieve records now and later on.
	==Subsequent Interviews
	During subsequent interviews, you’ll have the chance to get to know your client and his/her history. When you visit to discuss an upcoming court date or a development in the case, try to take the time to ask how the client is doing and to make some simply observations about his/her condition. Also try to introduce one or more of the topics listed below. Try to cover all of these areas over time so that you can be sure you’ve done a thorough mitigation investigation.
	As follow-up to your client interviews, gather information from other sources, including friends, family, teachers, neighbors, employers, coworkers, coaches, counsellors, etc. Records also contain invaluable information and frequently corroborate information obtained from the client or witnesses. Consider gathering medical records, school records, jail and correctional records, juvenile records, social welfare records, military records, court records, arrest records, and attorney files.
	You may not be able to do a complete social history investigation on each client, but be careful about making the decision that it’s not worthwhile in any individual case. Assistant Federal Public Defenders have recently received sentence reductions in gun and drug cases that, at first glance, appeared relatively ordinary. 
	Current Condition
	Checking in on the client’s current condition is a good way of building a relationship with the client, while at the same time identifying possible mitigation. You may see signs of cognitive impairment or mental illness, or you may learn good character mitigation, such as that the client is serving as a “trusty” on his cellblock or participating in a “Reality” program for school-kids. ==

	==Social History
	These topics are presented in rough chronological order, but you should feel free to pursue them in whatever order seems appropriate with a given client. Some clients will be unwilling to talk about their childhood at first, but may become more willing after they see the way you handle a discussion of their criminal history, hobbies, or employment background. If your client won’t or can’t answer a question, try asking your “ally.”

	In cases involving large volumes of data in a variety of media and/or file formats produced as part of the discovery and/or third party data obtained through independent investigation, the trial team should contact the National Litigation Support team and together try to answer the questions below. The answers will direct the work flow and assist the trial team in further planning their strategy and budget.==
	Is there any way to estimate the total volume of the discovery production even though some of it may come later?
	Will we be able to access all the data?
	Is any of the data encrypted?
	Are there specific types of documents that will be irrelevant to our case? (i.e. pictures, executable files, junk emails, etc.)
	Are there specific types of documents that will be very important to our case? (i.e. emails authored by a particular person, documents created during a specific time period, specific document types such as bank records, etc.)
	Are there both paper documents that have been scanned and native electronic files?
	Should we objectively code the scanned documents so that they can be integrated into the native file data set for purposes of searching and organization?
	Will there continue to be rolling discovery productions?
	Do we need to look at the entire production?
	Is there information that the government has not provided that needs to explicitly requested?
	In what format or formats do you want to request this information?
	Is there information that is not under the government’s control that needs to be obtained from 3rd party sources?
	In what format or formats is that information currently maintained?
	Can you obtain the third party information in a forensically sound manner so as to ensure proper chain of custody?
	Will the documents need to be shared among the Federal Defender Office, CJA Panel Attorneys and Retained Counsel?
	Does the trial team already have an Evidence Review Platform in their office that could handle the amount and variety of discovery involved?
	What is the timeline for completing the review?

	==An individual charged with driving while intoxicated has three main concerns: ==
	Driving Privileges
	The first concern is the State is trying to suspend his/her driving privileges because of the pending charges. Start by asking if the arresting officers took their driver’s license. If they still have their driver’s license, make a copy for your file, you may need the information later in your representation if you are hired. 
	Explain to them how important it is to have an administrative license revocation (ALR) hearing. Make them aware the hearing occurs in a different court and a different location from his/her criminal case. Advise them you will make this hearing on their behalf and they will not need to attend. It is actually in their best interest not to attend the hearing because the State could call them as a witness against himself/herself. 
	Timely filing an application for this hearing will keep the driving privileges from being suspended until the hearing can be held. The hearing before the administrative law judge must be requested no later than 15 days from the date of the State’s notice of the State’s intent to revoke the driving privileges. Date of notice is usually the day of arrest. If the 15 days have lapsed explain how their driving privileges will be automatically suspended 40 days after the notice. Make this hearing a part of your representation if it is not too late to file a request for the hearing. 
	Regarding their driving privilege: 
	What type of license do they have?
	Does their job require them to drive?
	What happens if they are not allowed to drive?
	What are the necessary driving times needed for work and/or personal errands?
	Have their driving privileges ever been suspended?
	Explain the effects on their driving privileges of an arrest and/or conviction for driving while intoxicated. For the suspension periods related to the client, refer to the DWI Suspension Period (cheat sheet) produced by the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association, sheet no. 7. Make sure they understand what they are facing regarding possible suspension of their driving privileges and assure them you will work diligently on their behalf to try and prevent the revocation of his/her driving privileges. 
	The second concern is the criminal charge and the possible consequences of a conviction. Make sure they completely know and understand the range of punishment he/she faces. 
	About the Criminal Charge
	Questions regarding the criminal charge of driving while intoxicated: (know the affect of his/her answers and make sure they understand how he/she will be affected) 
	What is their anticipation of what can be accomplish through your representation? 
	Have they, or anyone, made any prior court appearances on this charge? 
	When is the next scheduled appearance? 
	Have they ever been convicted of driving while intoxicated? 
	Do they have any prior convictions? 
	Will the pending charge or a conviction for driving while intoxication effect their job? 
	Will the pending charge or a conviction affect their ability to travel out of the country? 
	Do they feel they were intoxicated? 
	Where there any admissions to being intoxicated to any authority? 
	Have they posted anything about the arrest on the internet (social media)? 
	About The Individual
	Information you will need to know about your client after you are hired: 
	What are the drinking habits of the client? 
	Was the client taking medication? 
	Has the client had any prior injuries? 
	Do they have any physical or mental disabilities? 
	Are they under a doctor’s care? 
	What is their prior driving history? 
	Do they use unlawful drugs? 
	How much sleep had they had before arrest? 
	Do they have any speech impediments? 
	Have they ever been arrested for public intoxication? 
	About the Arrest
	Things you need to ask about the arrest: 
	What caused them to be arrested? 
	Date and time of the arrest? 
	Were they driving when they were arrested by the police officer? 
	Where were they going when the arrest occurred? 
	Where were they coming from? 
	Who saw them driving? 
	Where did the arrest occur? 
	Were they involved in any accident? 
	Were there any open containers of alcohol in the vehicle? 
	Any closed containers of alcohol in the vehicle? 
	Was anyone else with them when he/she was arrested? 
	Did they make statements to the arresting officer? 
	Did they perform any field sobriety tests? 
	Did they provide a sample of /her blood, breath or urine to the arresting officers? 
	How many police vehicles were on the scene of the arrest? 
	Did the police take them to a video room? 
	Was their vehicle towed to a storage yard or turned over to someone? 
	Where were they drinking before arrest? 
	What was the time of their last drink prior to the arrest? 
	What time did they eat prior to his/her arrest? 
	What time did they wake up/get up from sleeping on the day of his/her arrest? 
	What time did they have his/her first drink on the day of his/her arrest? 
	Had they had anything to drink on the previous day? 
	When would they say was the last time he/she was intoxicated? 
	How much alcohol did they consume on the day of arrest? 
	Who were they drinking with? 
	How did they pay for the alcohol? 
	Do they have any receipts for the alcohol? 
	Do they believe he/she has a problem with alcohol? 
	What is the age, weight and height of the client? 
	Consequences of Arrest and or Conviction
	Make sure they understand all the consequences of a conviction and what might occur while the charges are pending. During this phase you might want to discuss possible plea offers you anticipate the State will make. Make sure your client understands the consequences of pleading guilty to driving while intoxicated, even the downside of DIVERT. Make sure your client understands no plea offer should be entertained until the case is fully investigated, making sure the State will be able to make their case. 
	Petition for Occupational License
	The third concern is what will happen if my driving privileges are suspended. You need to discuss the petition for an occupational license and explain the process. Let your client know you can handle the petition and hearing for him/her. Explain the hearing may be in a civil court, which is completely separate from where his criminal charges are pending. 
	Conclusion
	Spending time with a potential client and providing answers for their concerns will pay dividends for the lawyer. A large percentage of individuals charged with driving while intoxicated have never been involved in the criminal justice system. They are concerned, scared and are looking for someone who can tell them what they are facing. Be that “someone”.

	==Mitigation – Telling the Client’s Story one Client copy - PPT
	Imagine you are defending this guy…arrested for PCS when police are serving a Blue Warrant at Client’s house and while searching the Client incident to arrest find a baggy of meth and a baggy of cocaine in Client’s shirt pocket. Client had Blue Warrant issued because he allegedly threatened to come back to the district parole office with a gun and shoot the entire place up. Client was a true habitual with Felony convictions going all the way back to 1977. Was a FOUNDING member of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas and still claimed membership. 
	There was another side to the story. 
	Protecting those of the Lord’s children who have fallen short of perfection from the wrath of those who have attained it. Stuart Kinnard
	Why Mitigation in Noncapital Cases: State Bar Performance Guidelines for Non Capital Defense Representation demand mitigation investigation and presentation. (Guidelines 1.2(c); 2.2(C)(5)(h); 4.1(B)(9)(e); 4.2(B)(3); 4.3; 8.1(c); 8.6(D). The Courts have ruled Defense Counsel has a duty to investigate and present mitigation evidence in noncaptical cases.
	US SUPREME COURT: In any criminal case, counsel must first evaluate what “conceivable line(s) of mitigating evidence” exist and then decide whether following any of those lines would likely lead to evidence that “would . . . assist the defendant at sentencing.” Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 3510, 521-22, 123 S. Ct. 2527, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2003).
	TEXAS COURTS: Failure to uncover and present mitigating evidence “cannot be justified as a tactical decision when defense counsel has not conducted a thorough investigation of the defendant’s background.” Shanklin v. State, 190 S.W.3d 154, 164 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, pet. dism’d); see also Bazan v. State, 403 S.W.3d 8, 13 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2012, pet. ref’d).==
	Mitigation in Non-Capital Cases
	What is Mitigation
	The mitigation investigation
	Presenting the mitigation evidence
	==What is Mitigation
	Alleviation; abatement or diminution of a penalty or punishment imposed by law.
	“Mitigating circumstances” are such as do not constitute a justification or excuse of the offense in question, but which, in fairness and mercy, may be considered as extenuating or reducing the degree of moral culpability.
	Another way to look at Mitigation…
	Being an effective story teller for your client in order to lessen the severity of the punishment your client is facing or receives
	Who is better to have tell your client’s story regarding your client’s punishment? You of the Prosecutor? YOU
	Sympathy v. Empathy
	Sympathy is defined as feelings of pity and sorry for someone else’s misfortune. Sympathy alone or mere Pity is never an effective Mitigation strategy
	Empathy is defined as getting another to understand and share the feelings of another. You always have a much better chance of achieving a positive result for your client if you can gain the Judge’s, Prosecutor’s or both’s empathy
	Mitigation is not trying to gain sympathy. Mitigation is about trying to gain an understanding of your client and their circumstances.==
	In order to effectively tell your client’s story, you must…
	Know your clients story (investigation)
	Develop a useful theme
	==How do you know your client’s story? Through a thorough and intensive mitigation investigation. 
	What are effective Mitigation Circumstances (Themes)==
	Remorse: The defendant accepts responsibility and shows remorse. For example, a defendant who confesses upon arrest and is contrite in court has this factor in his favor. 
	Lack of criminal record: The defendant doesn’t have a criminal record, or only has a relatively minor record. 
	No harm: The defendant didn’t hurt anyone and committed the crime in a manner unlikely to cause harm. An example would be if a Defendant carjacked a driver by sternly ordering her out of her car without pointing a weapon at the driver and carefully and gently helped driver out of car. 
	Minor role: The defendant played a relatively minor role in the crime. For example, suppose Defendant, a foot soldier, knowingly drove a Shotcaller in Defendant’s gang to a location where the Shotcaller made a drug deal. At sentencing for his conviction for Delivery of a controlled substance, Defendant has an argument that his small role in the criminal activity should be mitigating.
	Victim culpability: The victim willingly participated in the crime or initiated the events leading to it. For instance, if the complaining witness started a fight by attacking Defendant and Defendant responded with more force than was necessary to defend himself, this factor would be a mitigating factor at Defendant’s sentencing. 
	Unusual circumstance: The defendant committed the crime because of a temporary emotional difficulty or significant provocation and this caused the Defendant to act incongruous to the Defendant’s normal behavior and character. Ie – The perfect storm happened on the day the Defendant committed the crime. This circumstance usually applies when a defendant acts out while under extreme stress. 
	Relative necessity: The defendant acted out of a desire to provide life necessities. This theme would be potentially used for a recently laid off Defendant with no money who stole a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store so that he could feed his starving family.
	Addiction: Drug or alcohol addiction contributed to – but wasn’t just an incentive or excuse to commit – the crime. For instance if a someone continually committing petty thefts to fund drug usage. 
	Difficult personal history: The Defendant suffered continuous physical or sexual abuse either as a child or an adult. For example, battered woman syndrome.
	PTSD: The Defendant served in the military and as a result suffers from PTSD. Another example, a victim of a violent crime overacts during a confrontation and injures the complaining witness. 
	Mental Illness: Defendant suffers from some form of mental illness, or has a history of mental illness. This is particularly true is not properly treated.
	Institutional Failure: An example of institutional failure is the drug addict that has been through the criminal justice system many times but never received treatment to break the cycle of addiction.
	Lack of Family Structure/Absent Parent: Depends on the effect the lack of family or parent has on the individual.
	ANYTHING YOU THINK CAN GET THE TARGET AUDIENCE TO EMPATHIZE WITH YOUR CLIENT.
	==Don’t only focus on the negative aspects in Mitigation. Positives can be good mitigation themes also:==
	Someone is a good mother/father
	Someone is a good son/daughter
	Someone is a good sibling
	Someone I a good spouse
	Someone has made a positive impact in another persons life
	Someone has served the community (ie – volunteer or a public servant)
	Someone is extremely old or particularly young
	Someone is a good student
	Someone has a bright future ahead of them
	==You can combine together more than one mitigation circumstance or theme==
	For instance, someone who forced as a child to prostitute themselves by their mother, was given drugs to help her perform her required sexual acts, was never treated for her addictions despite numerous petty criminal convictions as a young adult is now charged with a crime as a young adult. You could combine as themes or mitigating circumstances – addiction, institutional failure, and difficult personal circumstance. 
	==Non-Capital Counsel can take a cue from Capital Counsel in effective Mitigation Themes==
	Capital Cases, the mitigation is required to focus on sentencing that takes into account the unique characteristics of the Defendant. – Tennard v. Dretke, 542 U.S. 274 (2004)
	==The same mitigation themes and circumstance that impact capital defendant’s and have been effective for capital defendant’s exist in our client’s Non-Capital cases==
	Examples: Poverty, Mental Retardation, Untreated or self treated mental illness, Addiction, Trauma, particularly head trauma, Lack of family structure/missing parent, Childhood history of abuse 
	How do you perform a mitigation investigation
	If at all possible, use a mitigation specialist (should be able to get one appointed under Ake and Greggs or make sure you build the cost into your fee)
	Incorporate a mitigation interview questions into counsels initial client interview
	Get a detailed family tree with contacts
	Mitigation/Punishment Witness interviews
	Identify and gather useful documents
	Potential People to Interview in Mitigation Investigation
	Client
	Client’s family
	Current Neighbors of Client
	Friends
	Preachers/Ministers
	Coaches
	Teachers
	Former Probation officers
	Former parole officers
	CPS workers is SPC was involved in Client’s life
	Employers/Co-Workers
	==Why a Mitigation Specialist==
	They are going to have expertise in gathering the documents and information necessary to tell the client’s story effectively
	They will have a network of experts needed to help develop the Clients story
	Mitigation specialists can help “connect the dots” and organize all the mitigation facts into a cohesive persuasive story
	Mitigation Specialists are trained to determine a Client’s deficits and create a plan to remedy or cure those deficits
	==Client Resistance to Mitigation Interview Questions==
	Clients don’t want to talk about mitigation or punishment because “I’m innocent” or “I didn’t do it” or some other variation
	In order to tell the client’s story, you have to get to know the client. Thus ask questions at first that help build a family tree and history, a social history, a medical history, employment history
	Let the client know you are just trying to get to know them as a person, as trust develops so will the other mitigation questions
	==Team Building Approach to Mitigation==
	Always try to make your client “part” of the team – get them invested in their own mitigation. Give them information to gather if on bond. If incarcerated, get them to give you the names of people to go to get the information you need.
	Use your Mitigation Specialist/Investigator to help gather documents and interview witnesses
	Look for younger attorneys who need experience and draft them to assist
	Develop your own network of experts and consult with them as needed
	==3 main areas of mitigation to look at==
	All the good the client has done in the past. This includes the client’s view of what good he has done, even if his view is not consistent with what society would think is good
	All the bad, sad and painful things that have happened to the client in their lifetime. Ie – What is the worst memory you have a childhood?
	Diagnostic questions designed to identify things such as head injuries, illness, substance abuse. Ie – do you remember as a kid ever having to go to the hospital? What for?
	==Questions you can ask to help develop possible mitigation evidence or themes==
	Are you on medications? If so what kinds and for how long?
	Ever gone to the hospital? If so what for? Which hospital? When? Where?
	Ever been diagnosed with a mental illness? If so what? When? By which doctor?
	Ever been hospitalized for mental health reasons? What for? When? Which hospital? By which doctor?
	Were you the victim of abuse (physical and/or sexual)? When? By whom? Did you report it to anyone and if so, who?
	What is your happiest memory?
	What is your favorite memory growing up?
	What is your earliest memory?
	What is something about you that you think would surprise me?
	==Develop a family tree==
	The best people to tell you about your client are the ones who have known him all his life. 
	Family members can tell you about things so traumatic to the client the client is repressing memories
	When a client is trying to minimize events or his actions in the past, family can help disprove the minimizations or help reveal the truth
	Family members can lead you to other potential sources of information such as friends of the client growing up, coaches or other close associates.
	==The Family interview==
	You have to build a relationship with the family to gain their trust
	You will have to overcome the family’s initial desire to only emphasize the good of their loved one or minimize the bad
	Realize that you will be potentially asking the family to reveal trauma, and this can be re-traumatizing. This can not be rushed. Requires building trust. 
	Do not judge
	Ask open ended questions
	Most importantly…LISTEN
	==Mitigation Witness Interviews==
	You have to build a relationship just like with the family to gain their trust
	Don’t be afraid to ask difficult questions. This is information you need
	Just like with the family, do not judge
	Ask open ended questions
	Most importantly….LISTEN
	==Goal of family/Witness interviews==
	Getting to learn the client’s story so you can effectively tell the client’s story
	Allow the defense/mitigation team to be able to see the Client through the eyes of people who see the Client not as a criminal but as a human being. Have to be able to humanize the client in order to effectively tell a story to gain empathy for the client.
	==Releases you will need your client to sign==
	A general HIPPA release
	A FURPA release for educational background
	HIPPA release specific to MHMR
	If a military veteran – a Veterans Administration release, a release to get the client’s military records
	These are documents you will need to start performing a paper mitigation investigation
	==Information helpful/needed to build a proper mitigation case==
	Medical history
	Family tree
	Mental health history
	Education history
	Employment history
	Military History
	Criminal History
	Full investigation into the crime itself
	==Presenting the Mitigation==
	Sometimes you will be presenting it to the Prosecutor pre-trial
	Sometimes you will be presenting it to a judge after a trial or punishment hearing
	Sometimes will have to present it to a jury after a trial
	This is where you connect the dots
	This is where you turn all the facts and data you have into a cohesive, persuasive story
	This is where you have to apply what you know into appropriate mitigation themes/mitigation circumstances
	The Ultimate goal is to tell your Client’s story in such a way that gets the intended target of your story gains empathy for your client
	==Presenting to the prosecutor==
	Have to overcome prosecutors automatic prejudice against client – have to gain empathy for your client
	Have to overcome prosecutor’s world view. Their view of justice is true justice. They are always in their minds fair – even when they are not being fair. Most any mitigation circumstance, alone, is an excuse and only an excuse. The Defendant is a liar and will lie to everyone. The defendant’s family are enablers.
	If you succeed in getting the prosecutor to see your client as a human being and not just another “Defendant” you can get the prosecutor to start empathizing with your client
	==Presenting to a Judge==
	Once again, your story has to gain empathy from the judge
	Judges have to get re-elected, so your story should help convince a judge to take a chance on your client and that act of “kindness” won’t be rewarded by the client coming back to haunt the judge
	Sometimes have to overcome the same world views you have to overcome when presenting to a prosecutor
	==Presenting to a jury==
	Has to start at voir dire. Not only educate the jurors on the punishment range, but also on the mitigation themes. Have to identify jurors predisposed not to listen to your mitigation theme.
	Through your client’s story, you have to educate the juror’s to see your Client’s world and the realities they live in. Usually a juror’s view of the world miles away from the reality of your client
	Not trying to make excuses for your Client’s conduct, trying to gain empathy from the jury
	Try to get the target audience to understand, who must not be defined by the worst thing they ever did
	People may forget what you tell them or what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. 
	Tell a cohesive, persuasive story for your client and you will be able to gain the necessary empathy for your client to gain a result that very well may save a significant portion of their life!!!!
	==THE CLIENT INTERVIEW: A TOPICAL CHECKLIST
	In developing mitigation for post-Booker sentencings, our clients are often our best and most accessible source of information. In the abstract, the mitigation possibilities seem endless, and it may be difficult to decide what to ask our clients and how to ask it. This checklist is designed to give you some guidance. Although it is not intended as a script for client interviews, it may be useful for attorneys to review the checklist in connection with each case as a brainstorming tool.
	In collecting information from clients, remember two important principles: First, try not to be too result-oriented. Sometimes, you just have to listen and let the client take the interview where he/she wants to go. You will not elicit too much useful information if you exert too much control in the conversation. Second, be alert to verbal and non-verbal cues suggesting abuse, mental illness, or cognitive impairment. See Deana Logan, Learning to Observe Signs of Mental Impairment (distributed in connection with May 2005 CJA Panel Training). Sometimes, your client won’t be able to tell you what’s mitigating, but you’ll discern it through careful observation. 
	If you have any questions about a client’s response to questions or a behaviour you observe, you may want to consult the library of materials on mental health issues in criminal cases and conducting mitigation investigation, assembled by Assistant Federal Public Defenders Denise Barrett and Frank Draper, and available at the FPD’s Baltimore office. Also consider consulting a social worker, a mitigation specialist, or a mental health professional. 
	Initial Interview
	This basic information should be collected early on (at the initial appearance, if possible). These are the questions asked at intake by Assistant Federal Public Defenders. The answers provide the basis for establishing a “family liaison” (a close friend or family member of the client who can become an ally for the attorney during the investigation & litigation), and beginning the investigation (ordering basic documents such as education, criminal, and medical records).==

	Circumstances of any statements (oral, written, read rights, invoke rights, length, place, method of interrogation)
	When taken to magistrate
	At the initial meeting, also have the client complete release of information forms (copies distributed in connected with Mary 2005 CJA Training), so you can easily retrieve records now and later on.
	==Subsequent Interviews
	During subsequent interviews, you’ll have the chance to get to know your client and his/her history. When you visit to discuss an upcoming court date or a development in the case, try to take the time to ask how the client is doing and to make some simply observations about his/her condition. Also try to introduce one or more of the topics listed below. Try to cover all of these areas over time so that you can be sure you’ve done a thorough mitigation investigation.
	As follow-up to your client interviews, gather information from other sources, including friends, family, teachers, neighbors, employers, coworkers, coaches, counsellors, etc. Records also contain invaluable information and frequently corroborate information obtained from the client or witnesses. Consider gathering medical records, school records, jail and correctional records, juvenile records, social welfare records, military records, court records, arrest records, and attorney files.
	You may not be able to do a complete social history investigation on each client, but be careful about making the decision that it’s not worthwhile in any individual case. Assistant Federal Public Defenders have recently received sentence reductions in gun and drug cases that, at first glance, appeared relatively ordinary. 
	Current Condition
	Checking in on the client’s current condition is a good way of building a relationship with the client, while at the same time identifying possible mitigation. You may see signs of cognitive impairment or mental illness, or you may learn good character mitigation, such as that the client is serving as a “trusty” on his cellblock or participating in a “Reality” program for school-kids. ==

	==Social History
	These topics are presented in rough chronological order, but you should feel free to pursue them in whatever order seems appropriate with a given client. Some clients will be unwilling to talk about their childhood at first, but may become more willing after they see the way you handle a discussion of their criminal history, hobbies, or employment background. If your client won’t or can’t answer a question, try asking your “ally.”
