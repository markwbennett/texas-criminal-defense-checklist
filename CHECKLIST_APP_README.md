## How to Modify the Template

The template file (`CriminalDefenseChecklist.txt`) uses a simple format:

### Format Rules:
- **Tabs** = hierarchy (more tabs = deeper nesting)
- **_** at end of line = fillable field (e.g., `Phone_`)
- **#FORM** / **#FORMEND** = form sections (kept together)
- **#Note:** = explanatory notes (displayed in italics)
- **#End** = stop processing (everything after ignored)
- **#** alone = comment (not displayed)

### Example:
```
Main Section
	Subsection
	Another Subsection
		Detail item
		Name_
		#Note: This is a helpful note
		#FORM
			Form content here
			Line 1
			Line 2
		#FORMEND
```

### To Edit:
1. Open `CriminalDefenseChecklist.txt` in any text editor
2. Make your changes (add/remove items, change text)
3. Save the file
4. In the web app, click "Load Template" again
5. New clients will use the updated template

## Data Storage

### Where is data stored?
- **Browser localStorage** (automatic, no setup needed)
- **Your computer only** (not sent anywhere)
- Data persists between sessions

### Data Location by Browser:
- Each browser has separate storage
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari = different storage
- Use Export/Import to move between browsers

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Backup Your Data Regularly

**Browser localStorage can be cleared by:**
- Clearing browser cache/cookies
- Browser updates or crashes
- Switching browsers
- Computer issues

**To protect your data:**

**Option 1: Export All (Recommended - Easiest)**
1. Click **"üì¶ Export All"** button in the header
2. Save the backup file (named `all_clients_backup_YYYY-MM-DD.json`)
3. Store in a safe location (cloud storage, external drive)
4. Repeat weekly or after significant updates

**Option 2: Export Individual Clients**
1. Click "Export" on each client card
2. Save individual `.json` files
3. Useful for sharing specific cases or selective backups

**To restore:**
- **Restore all clients:** Click "üìÇ Import All" and select your backup file (replaces all current data)
- **Restore one client:** Click "üì• Import Client" and select an individual `.json` file (adds to existing clients)

## Troubleshooting

### "Template not loading"
- Make sure you selected the correct `.txt` file
- Check that the file is not corrupted
- Try opening the `.txt` file in a text editor to verify it's readable

### "My clients disappeared"
- Check if you're using the same browser
- Try importing from your backup `.json` files
- Clear browser cache might have deleted localStorage (always keep backups!)

### "Items won't check"
- Try refreshing the page
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Try exporting and re-importing the client
